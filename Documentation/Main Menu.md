### Overview
The main menu should be a simple UI
- If the user selects 'Client' they'll fill out a form with username, server address and password
- If the user selects 'Server', they'll fill out a form with a password and port

After filling out the form, the scene should be cleared. Or maybe it should be generally stateless to begin with?
